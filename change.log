 - New: Added PR 132: "Multi-threaded downloads and caching" from https://github.com/ndbroadbent/icloud_photos_downloader/pull/132
 - New: Added quotes to variables to prevent globbing in download check and photo download functions

 - New: Added interactive_only variable. Some hosts only run containers interactively (looking at you Synology) and this means the script gets stuck attempting to create a 2FA cookie every time. Setting interactive_only will force the script to bypass the cookie generation function and sync files instead.

 - New: Log now displays OS version

 - Removal: Removed feature to delete JPG file if the HEIC has been removed. Floored logic in that all files exist in a single location, which doesn't match their original location. Also, JPG files received by WhatsApp would be removed as would JPG files saved from Safari. Can't work in practice.
 - New: Script now has a command line parameter that can be run from an interactive session. --ConvertAllHEICs will scan all HEIC files and convert them to JPG, provided the JPG doesn't exist already.
 - Change: Convert HEIC to JPEG not working correctly.

 - Change: Running the sync client with "--only-print-filenames" actually creates folders too. File check now run as user account instead of root to avoid ownership issues.

 - Change: Fancy Telegram notifications caused the underscore characters in the file previews to be displayed in italics. Should be correctly escaped now.

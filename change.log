 - Change: Amended the interactive terminal check to see if /dev/stdin is a pipe. Odd issue seen on some systems.

20200808

 - Change: Updated READ.ME

20200807

 - Change: Updated READ.ME
 - Change: Apply diff patch to fix album naming issue raised here: https://github.com/ndbroadbent/icloud_photos_downloader/issues/150

20200806

 - Change: Removed manual versioning in Dockerfile in favour of MD5 script hash. Means I don't need to track version numbers, or remember to increment them, but latest version can be confirmed quite easily from the log
 - Change: Added owner change to /config dir at start of ConfigurePassword function so password is successfully stored first time around.

20200803

 - Change: Converted docker-compose.yml file to be 3.8 compatible. Removed networking configuration.

20200803

 - Change: When using keyring it was claiming plaintext password was in use and vice versa.
 - Change: Added a version number in Dockerfile to display when script first starts up.

20200802

 - Change: Found that the --directory option is required. I wasn't including it when doing the 2FA authentication cookie generation which lead to an error.

20200608

 - Change: Rebased to Alpine 3.12.
 - Change: Display IP Address in log.

20200528

 - Alpha change: Changed Webhook notification messages.
 - Alpha change: Forgot to add webhook_id to the check which validates that the API keys have been set.

20200527

 - Alpha change: Webhook host_ip_address variable changed to webhook_server. Added webhook_port so a non-default port can be added.

20200526

 - Alpha: Webhook notifications implemented for Home Assistant. Based on Telegram notifications, but implemented without testing. Using them will probably break things as I'm unsure as to the format of the webhook payload.

20200519

 - Change: Prefixed some of the files stored in /tmp/icloudpd with icloudpd_, just for consistency. Plus it's easier to remove them all with `rm icloudpd*` instead of multiple arguments to rm.
 - New: Keyring password saving. Previously, the Apple ID user's password could be seen in the Docker logs, the variables (docker inspect) and disturbingly, if any user did `ps -ef | grep password", it would be seen in the command line of any running connection to iCloud. Script now heavily pushes users towards saving credentials into the secure encrypted keyring.
 - Removal: Saving password to text file has been removed (never made it to a release, but is doumented in the change log). 
 - Change: su doesn't pass variables to the account it uses. This meant that some variables that I thought were optional (user, config_dir, folder_structure) were actually mandatory. Command now built with $0 $1 $2 etc and variables passed via command line ( -- $bunch $of $options).
 - Removal: Debug logging variable removed. Always logging errors to screen.
 - Change: Telegram notification success/failure messages now confirm message type (startup, download, delete, failure).
 - Change: Cookie checking function would hang system without error if 2FA cookie does not exist.

20200518

 - Change: Container now saves the Apple ID password to a file located in the /config volume. Once this has been done, the apple_password variable not longer needs to be passed to the container and should be removed.

20200517

 - Change: Moved some of the logging commands so they triggered in more appropriate places.
 - Change: File download check error notification incorrectly labelled as a startup notification.
 - Change: Script wasn't properly handling passwords with special characters. Should be OK now.
 - Change: Amended the failsafe error message so that the name and path of the file it is looking for is visible. Makes it easier for people to spot the capitalisation in iCloud.
 - Change: File check exit code grabbing logic was flawed. Was actually grabbing the exit code of su, which was always 0.

20200514

 - Change: Previous change didn't work. This actually fixes the issue that the list of files is no longer growing. However, it's only highlighted a different issue. A number of files are exhibiting weird behaviour. 5 files are being listed as downloaded, but only 3 filenames are unique. These files are then also being listed as having been deleted from the system. They are all stil in my photostream on iCloud.com and not in recently deleted. Coincidentally, they all start with camphoto_ but that may not be indicitive of anything.

20200508

 - Change: My list of downloaded/deleted files seemed to be getting longer without me actively using my phone's camera. Guessing some variable isn't being cleared, so have localised a fair few variables to the functions they run in.

20200430

 - Change: Added $debug_logging variable, which outputs errors to the screen instead of hiding them.

20200413

 - Remove: Removed PR 132. PR 132 was based off PR 110, which was raised in 2018. Neither had been merged. Obviously, after I spent an hour or so chainging my Dockerfile to incorporate the patch, it was merged upstream!

20200412

 - New: Added PR 132: "Multi-threaded downloads and caching" from https://github.com/ndbroadbent/icloud_photos_downloader/pull/132.
 - New: Added quotes to variables to prevent globbing in download check and photo download functions.

20200313

 - New: Added interactive_only variable. Some hosts only run containers interactively (looking at you Synology) and this means the script gets stuck attempting to create a 2FA cookie every time. Setting interactive_only will force the script to bypass the cookie generation function and sync files instead.

20200313

 - New: Log now displays OS version.

20200309

 - Removal: Removed feature to delete JPG file if the HEIC has been removed. Floored logic in that all files exist in a single location, which doesn't match their original location. Also, JPG files received by WhatsApp would be removed as would JPG files saved from Safari. Can't work in practice.
 - New: Script now has a command line parameter that can be run from an interactive session. --ConvertAllHEICs will scan all HEIC files and convert them to JPG, provided the JPG doesn't exist already.
 - Change: Convert HEIC to JPEG not working correctly.

20200217

 - Change: Running the sync client with "--only-print-filenames" actually creates folders too. File check now run as user account instead of root to avoid ownership issues.

20200211

 - Change: Fancy Telegram notifications caused the underscore characters in the file previews to be displayed in italics. Should be correctly escaped now.

20200209

 - Change: Odd issue where owner on config directoy changed to root. Added chown at start of sync to fix this, and also to Owner/Permissions setting function.
 - New: Fancy pants Telegram notifications with emojis.
 - Removal: Telegram URL Encoding function. Now sending markdown text and UTF-8 for special characters.
 - Change: Renamed $syncronisation_interval variable to $synchronisation_interval.

20200123

 - Update: Now based on Alpine Linux 3.11.
 - New: Apple ID displayed on push notifications.
 - Update: ARM images rebuilt to latest version.

20200122 - Changes:

 - New: HEIC to JPEG conversion.
 - New: JPEG removal if original HEIC  removed (experimental, backup your files!).
 - Change: Code changes for readability and simplicity.
 - New: Added example docker-compose.yaml.

20200118

 - Change: Variable name changes for readability and naming accuracy.
 - New: Pre-download check for new files so a download run will only occur if new files exist.
 - New: Telegram notifications.
 - New: Synchronisation summary. Number of new files downloaded. Number of deleted files (if --auto-delete enabled).
 - New: Telegram notifications only: List of downloaded filenames (10 max). List of deleted files (10 max).
 - New: Startup notification.
 - New: Configurable permissions on the download destination directory.
 - Change: Logic re-writes for simplicity and optimisation.
 - Change: Additional logging.
 - Change: Code clean-ups.
 - Change: Healthcheck update.
